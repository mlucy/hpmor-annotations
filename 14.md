place of 'Harad' and 'Khabaal'.

```
There were mysterious questions, but a mysterious answer was a
contradiction in terms.
```

* note

This is a line from later in the chapter, probably a reiteration that
the author doesn't intend to leave open questions.

It was at this point that Harry realised he was faced with a priceless
and possibly irreplaceable opportunity to offer Professor McGonagall a
Comed-Tea

Oh, right, she's expecting me to blackmail her for information about
the prophecy.

return I will keep your secrets.`)

"Well, yes, of course," Harry said. There was no need to admit how
long it had taken him to actually think of that. "As opposed to, say,
trying to research it myself, or telling any of the other children."
```

* original

This is poking fun at the original series - the other path sounds more
typical of the main characters' antics.

---

```
"And if, perhaps, you were to discover the entrance to Salazar
Slytherin's legendary Chamber of Secrets, an entrance that you and you
alone could open..."
```

* original

An even more direct reference to the original series, in which Harry
and Ron discover the chamber and explore it themselves, without
bringing it to the attention of the school administrators.

---

```
"It's obvious if you're not a Gryffindor," Harry said kindly.
```

* original

An explanation on why Harry is acting so differently here - implying
that Gryffindors are rather stupidly heroic.

```
"Mr. Potter," McGonagall said, and now her voice was low, "five
decades ago was the last time a student died within the walls of
Hogwarts, and I am now certain that five decades ago was the last time
someone heard that message."
```

Referring specifically to the last time the Chamber of Secrets was
opened when Voldemort was still a student at Hogwarts.  Voldemort was
the one to hear the message, and when he opened the chamber, the
basilisk killed a student (and Hagrid was framed).

```
Apparently that business with refusing offers of monetary rewards
until you got a magic item actually worked in real life, not just
computer games.
```

* reference

In many computer games, particularly RPGs, upon completing a quest the
player is usually given a reward.  If the player refuses that reward,
the quest-giver will usually offer a different means of compensation.
From a balance perspective, this is typically done so a player doesn't
feel discouraged from playing a certain type of character.  In a
similar way, McGonagall is trying to find a way to encourage Harry to
be good by rewarding this behavior.

Spontaneous Duplication
```

A clever cover for the effects of the Time-Turner.  If other students
happen to see two Harry Potters, it can be blamed on this (TODO:
fictional?) ailment.

"Perhaps," Harry said when he could speak again, "you ought to provide
your time machines with some sort of protective shell, rather than
leaving the glass exposed, so as to prevent that from happening."
```

* original

While this serves to show the lack of critical thinking in the
wizarding world, it is also a jab at the source material.

The perfect, stereotypical image of a Christmas present, although it
wasn't Christmas.
```

* original
* spoiler

This gift was from Dumbledore in the original series, and given to
Harry in Christmas of his first year.  It is likely that this was
accelerated like many other things in this series.  TODO: was
Dumbledore still the source of this gift?  Reference

---

```
If Dumbledore saw a chance to possess one of the Deathly Hallows, he
would never let it escape his grasp until the day he died.
```

* spoiler

Dumbledore does in fact have a Deathly Hallow - the wand, which
typically changes hands when its owner dies.  And this is exactly what
happens in the original series.

```
"Understood," said Harry, swallowing hard. "Um, shouldn't you tell
students all that sort of stuff right away?"

Harry is a little annoyed that he had to figure out this technique on
his own.
