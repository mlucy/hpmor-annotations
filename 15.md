```
Love as thou Rowling
```

* reference

A reference to the Kushiel's Legacy saga by Jacqueline Carey.  The
deity Elau has a precept, "Love as thou wilt."

"I'm sure I'll find the time somewhere."
```

* note

A quote from Harry later in the chapter.  It is a bit more meaningful
given that he has just acquired a Time-Turner, and now has more free
time on his hands than others would suspect.

```
And it was starting to look like he had a mysterious dark side.
```

This is the first time it is explicitly called a **mysterious dark
side**.

He wanted to write someone and demand a refund on his dark side which
clearly ought to have irresistible magical power but had turned out to
be defective.

There are various overlapping tropes for this, but it is common
enough: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide

* spoiler

As it turns out, Harry is already using his mysterious dark side, it
is the reason he is not like other kids and why he has excelled so
much in his life to this point.

"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you
will learn at Hogwarts," said Professor McGonagall. There was no trace
of any levity upon the face of the stern old witch. "Anyone messing
around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been
warned."
```

* original
* foreshadowing

While this is the exact same intro given by McGonagall in the original
series, the rest of this scene establishes much more hard and fast
rules on Transfiguration, with more of a scientific basis.  This
foreshadows the importance that Transfiguration will play in this
series.
