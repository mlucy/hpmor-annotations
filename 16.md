A reference to "The enemy's gate is down", an insight from Ender's
game that in 0 gravity you can orient yourself whichever way you want.
(Probably meant to be an example of lateral thinking.)

This may be referring to Harry's opinions of most of his teachers

Harry was taken by surprise, both by the sudden appearance of
Professor Quirrell's face and by the resemblance to Muggle television.
```

* subtle

This is one of the first hints that Quirrell knows a surprising amount
about Muggle technology -- enough to have clever ideas related to it.

Most fearsome of all, the troll is unique among magical creatures in
continuously maintaining a form of Transfiguration on itself - it is
always transforming into its own body.
```

* spoiler

This comes into play later.  Because of this property, mountain trolls
can be transfigured into something small, smuggled somewhere, and then
untransfigured (normally this would kill the creature).  (108/`I wore
the mountain troll as a false tooth`)

Likewise if you are facing the second most perfect killing machine, a
Dementor.
```

This is the first hint about the nature of Dementors in HPMOR -- the
killing curse doesn't work on them, so by Quirrell's logic they can't
have brains, and yet they're capable of complicated actions.

Note that he does not say these monsters can't threaten you *before*
you are fully grown.  And, in fact, a troll later kills Hermione.

Professor Quirrell was in Ravenclaw in both HPMOR and the original
timeline.  This is Voldemort pretending to mess up and leak that he is
not professor Quirrell.  Later it comes out that his plan was to
pretend to be David Munroe pretending to be professor Quirrell.
(84/`But I shall tell a story`).

Demonstrate his supposed immunity to the Killing Curse? Surely
Professor Quirrell was too smart for that...

Professor Quirrell is, in fact, intensely aware of the fact that Harry
is not immune to the killing curse.
