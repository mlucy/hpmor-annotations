Asking the Wrong Questions

A reference to later in the chapter, when Harry does in fact ask the
wrong questions and get penalized for it in the game.

```
Elen sila J. K. Rowling omentielvo
```

* note
* reference

This is a modified version of a phrase from Elvish in the Lord of the
Rings universe: "Elen sila lumenn' omentielvo", meaning "A star shines
on the hour of our meeting".  This modified version would mean
something along the lines of "A star shines on the J. K. Rowling of
our meeting".

"That's one of the most obvious riddles I've ever heard."
```

* title-quote
* speculation

A flash-forward to later in the chapter.  This note may be intended to
prime readers to be thinking in terms of riddles from the very beginning.

---

```
"I haven't forgotten" were written in a different style, as if he was
trying to tell himself something...?
```

* spoiler

He hasn't forgotten, because he wrote the note after using a
**Time-Turner**.

Harry gets a Time-Turner this morning, and decides to go back and
prank himself.  The entire game is perpetrated by him.

---

```
Please play the game. You can only play the game once in a
lifetime. This is an irreplaceable opportunity.
```

* spoiler

You can only play the game once in a lifetime, within 6 hours of
learning about **Time-Turner**s.

```
Welp, that was a puzzler, all right. It was only his first day at
school and once you ruled out Dumbledore, he didn't know the name of
anyone else here who was this crazy.
```

* subtle
* spoiler

This is probably the first hint that Harry is behind the game, since
he's the only other character who has been explicitly called out as
acting a little insane and spreading chaos wherever he goes.
(5/`"What part of 'get fitted for robes' sounded to you like please
cast a Confundus Charm on the entire universe!"`)

Harry probably doesn't consider this hypothesis, because his actually
usually look less insane from the inside, and this is the first time
he's encountering himself from the outside.

a crumpled envelope and some green and red wrapping paper
```

These are the remains of the gift containing the invisibility cloak
along with the accompanying letter (14/`a box, wrapped in red and
green paper`), which was opened by the future Harry before past Harry
woke up.

```
an Escher painting
```

* reference
* link

M. C. Escher was an artist known for depicting impossible objects.
This, specifically may be calling back to one of Escher's most famous
works, Relativity
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_%28M._C._Escher%29).
However, this bit is somewhat incorrect, Escher did not produce many
paintings - these sorts of works were typically lithographs.

---

```
"Are you -" Harry said, and then shut his mouth. On second thought, no
he was NOT going to ask the painting whether it was fully conscious in
the sense of being aware of its own awareness.
```

* callback

Thinking this about the sorting hat caused it to become conscious
(10/`he wondered if the Sorting Hat was genuinely conscious in the
sense of being aware of its own awareness`).

---

```
Well then, as a general rule, if you keep on turning left, you're
bound to keep going down."

That sounded strangely familiar but Harry couldn't recall where he'd
heard it before.
```

* spoiler
* subtle
* speculation

It's unclear exactly what this is referring to.  Several hypothesis:

* Harry's **mysterious dark side** has in fact heard this advice
  before.

* It sounds similar to the left-hand rule for solving mazes.

* It's a reference to the Left-Hand Path, which is a generic occult
  term for a variety of black magics.

---

```
The lady curtseyed to him. "I wish I could say that I'll remember you
with fondness," she said, "but I probably won't remember you at all.
Farewell, Harry Potter."
```

* spoiler

This suggests that ghosts and paintings are subject to the same rules.
They are snapshots of a wizard's mind at a specific point in time,
and cannot learn new things aside from short-term interactions.

---

```
"It was spoken by a hollow voice that belled forth from a gap within
the air itself, a gap that opened upon a fiery abyss! That's what they
told me!"
```

* spoiler

This is a lie, Harry just pretended to be another link in the chain,
and made up an ominous-sounding source. (14/`Harry shrugged with
artful helplessness. "I was told`)

---

```
"That's one of the most obvious riddles I've ever heard."
```

* spoiler
* subtle
* speculation

It's worth remembering whenever you hear the word "riddle" that it
might be a reference to Tom Riddle, which can refer to either
Voldemort or Harry (due to his **mysterious dark side**).  (Harry is
talking to her, so she's hearing him.)

This particular occurance is somewhat weak, however, and may just be a
coincidence.

---

```
All I can tell you is that if this were a riddle, the answer would be
that the game is life, and that while we do not make all the rules
ourselves, the one who awards or takes points is always you. If it is
not riddle but reality - then I do not know.
```

* spoiler

Harry is, in fact, the one giving and taking the points.

---

```
Minus ten points for being slow! Now you have 61 points! That was the
rest of the message!"
```

* spoiler

The fact that this random portrait already knows exactly how many
points Harry will have after having 10 deducted is a strong hint that
there's some sort of precognition in play (in this case, Harry already
observed all of this before traveling back in time).

(Either that or the mysterious force that controls the game is
controlling the portrait in some more direct way than old messages
passed through other portraits.)

---

```
"It was spoken by a hollow voice that belled forth from a gap within
the air itself, a gap that opened upon a fiery abyss! That's what they

This is a lie, Harry just pretended to be another link in the chain,
and made up an ominous-sounding source. (14/`Harry shrugged with
artful helplessness. "I was told`)

---

```
Then Harry lifted his other hand, said "Abracadabra," and snapped his
fingers.
```

* original

**snap his fingers**

It was likely no mistake in the original series that the incantation
for the Killing Curse "Avada Kedavra" sounds similar to "Abracadabra".
Here, that relation is unwittingly abused by Harry.

---

```
Slowly, the largest Slytherin reached up to his head, and peeled off
the pan of cherry pie that had just draped itself over him.
```

Harry produced this effect by being in the hallway while under his
invisibility cloak and throwing the pie.

"No," said Harry. "But when you're telling everyone this story be sure
to share it with Hermione Granger in first-year Ravenclaw, she has an
anecdote you might find amusing."
```

* callback

The anecdote is the experiment with the **Comed-Tea** on the train.
(8/`I can make anything I want happen just by snapping my fingers`)

---

```
Harry smiled smugly. "I can make anything I want happen just by
snapping my fingers."
```

* spoiler

Harry will threaten to **snap his fingers** *many* times over the
course of the story.

---

```
Though it had produced an effect that might be tactically useful.
```

* spoiler
* foreshadowing
* subtle

This sort of thinking is representative of Harry's **mysterious dark
side**.  Later on Quirrell makes a very similar statement (60/`In a
real fight, a curse which cannot be blocked and must be dodged is an
indispensable tactic.`).

---

```
When I saw that I just got... really angry...
```

* spoiler

**mysterious dark side**

---

```
He wondered how much the Game Controller cared about that sort of
thing, and whether he'd won or lost points for it. Harry himself felt
like he'd lost quite a few points, and he was sure the old lady in the
picture would have told him that his was the only opinion that
mattered.
```

* spoiler

Yet another hint that Harry is running the game.

---

```
the Head of House Hufflepuff would be the last person anyone would
suspect, which ought to put her near the top of Harry's list.
```

* spoiler
* foreshadowing

Professor Quirrell has this same thought later in the series, and uses
Professor Sprout as his evil pawn for just this reason.

---

```
A sheet of paper flew over his head, as if someone had thrown it from

Harry is standing behind himself under his invisibility cloak.

---

```
ASKING THE WRONG QUESTIONS: -1,000,000,000,000 POINTS
```

* speculation

Harry is definitely asking the wrong questions.  This game implies the
existence of a bunch of new and powerful, but not necessarily hostile,
elements of the world that he doesn't understand, and he's still
concerned with whether or not it's fair and whether or not he can win.

Also, there is a certain correspondence between this and the test with
the **Comed-Tea** that Harry put Hermione through on the train.  In
both cases there's a mysterious phenomenon to investigate, and in both
cases the investigator asks entirely the wrong questions.

---

```
And after this whole long journey of self-discovery he would learn at
the end that his anger was a part of himself and that only by
accepting it could he learn to use it wisely.
