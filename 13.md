```
Elen sila J. K. Rowling omentielvo.
```

This is a modified version of a phrase from Elvish in the Lord of the
Rings universe: "Elen sila lumenn' omentielvo", meaning "A star shines
on the hour of our meeting".  This modified version would mean
something along the lines of "A star shines on the J. K. Rowling of
our meeting".

"That's one of the most obvious riddles I've ever heard."
```

* note

This is a quote from a painting later on in this chapter.  Seeing as
the entire chapter is presented as a riddle, it is a fitting quote to
set the theme.

```
I am a potato.
```

* speculation
* reference

This may be a reference to GLaDOS in the game Portal 2, who at one
point says "I'm a potato."  This would not be the in-character genesis
of the phrase, however, since this takes place long before Portal 2
was released.

```
once you ruled out Dumbledore, he didn't know the name of anyone else
here who was this crazy
```

* spoiler

Since Harry turns out to be behind the game, it is ironic that he
thinks this - by his own admission, Harry's level of craziness should
be close to Dumbledore's.

These are the remains of the gift containing the invisibility cloak
along with the accompanying letter (14/`a box, wrapped in red and
green paper`), which was opened by the future Harry before past Harry
woke up.

an Escher painting
```

* link

M. C. Escher was an artist known for depicting impossible objects.
This, specifically may be calling back to one of Escher's most famous
works, Relativity
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_%28M._C._Escher%29).
However, this bit is somewhat incorrect, Escher did not produce many
paintings - these sorts of works were typically lithographs.

to
```

* speculation

TODO: I'm not sure exactly what he's referring to by 'beggars' here.
I suspect it's that they are a common source of directions, but maybe
I missed something.

```
That sounded strangely familiar but Harry couldn't recall where he'd
heard it before.
```

TODO: what?

```
The lady curtseyed to him. "I wish I could say that I'll remember you
with fondness," she said, "but I probably won't remember you at all.
Farewell, Harry Potter."
```

* spoiler

This suggests that ghosts and paintings are subject to the same rules.
They are snapshots of a wizard's mind at a specific point in time,
and cannot learn new things aside from short-term interactions.

"It was spoken by a hollow voice that belled forth from a gap within
the air itself, a gap that opened upon a fiery abyss! That's what they
told me!"
```

* spoiler

This is a lie, Harry just pretended to be another link in the chain,
and made up an ominous-sounding source. (14/`Harry shrugged with
artful helplessness. "I was told`)

```
Then Harry lifted his other hand, said "Abracadabra," and snapped his
fingers.
```

* original

**snap his fingers**
It was likely no mistake in the original that the incantation for the
Killing Curse "Avada Kedavra" sounds similar to "Abracadabra".  Here,
that relation is unwittingly abused by Harry.

And after this whole long journey of self-discovery he would learn at

accepting it could he learn to use it wisely.
