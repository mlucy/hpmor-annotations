And now you will sit through the Sorting Hat singing its version of Evanescence's "My Immortal", which has never happened before.
```

* note

A joke based on the last line of the previous chapter (which is repeated a few lines down), when the Sorting Hat says, "Oh dear, this has never happened before."  The choice of song does not appear to be important aside from the comedic effect of angsty teen music.

```
can you tell me anything about how to rediscover the lost magics that created you?
```

* spoiler
* callback

Harry is worried by his discussion with Draco (TODO: reference) that magic may be draining from the world, so he is looking for a way to stem the tide.  This is not far from how Voldemort rediscovered lost magic from the basilisk guarding the Chamber of Secrets (TODO: reference), but it is unlikely the Sorting Hat could pass much knowledge to Harry due to the Interdict of Merlin (TODO: reference).

Considering Harry's **mysterious dark side** comes from a Dark Lord, this is a really big clue.

No, what you remembered was how you considered lining up all the blood purists and guillotining them.

Harry actually does decapitate all the Death Eaters (TODO: reference), but in more of a semi-circle than a line.

Apparently there were safeguards to prevent you from saying anything out loud by accident, while you were under the Hat talking about things you would never tell another soul for the rest of your life.

Pretty sure this is different from the original.  TODO: cross-check

Harry later generals the Chaos Legion, whose battle cry is "DOOM", chanted to the tune of the Imperial March (TODO: reference).
