"I don't sleep right," Harry said. He waved his hands helplessly. "My
sleep cycle is twenty-six hours long, I always go to sleep two hours
later, every day. I can't fall asleep any earlier than that, and then
the next day I go to sleep two hours later than that. 10PM, 12AM, 2AM,

your bedroom in Oxford and administered the potion that is given to
students with Time-Turners`) as part of his **prophecy-threading**
project.
