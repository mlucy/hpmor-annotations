thine is the kingdom

This is a reference to the Lord's Prayer, specifically the translation
in the King James Bible: "[... And lead us not into temptation, but
deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power,
and the glory, for ever. Amen. [...]".  The author is likening
J.K. Rowling to God with this phrase.

This is a flash-forward to later in the chapter when Harry is talking
to Draco.

---

```
It's like she's afraid she'll never see me again, the thought popped
into Harry's head. He knew the thought was true but he didn't know why
Mum was so afraid.
```

* speculation

Harry thinks his mom is worried that magic will come between them, but
he doesn't consider that his mom might instead be worried about how
her sister died in a magical war 10 years ago (although it's unclear
how much she knows about the circumstances of her sister's death in
this universe).

---

```
There were no questions about his father accompanying him to the
magical side of King's Cross Station. Dad had trouble just looking at
Harry's trunk directly. Magic ran in families, and Michael
Verres-Evans couldn't even walk.
```

* spoiler

Remember that the trunk is walking around on its own.

This is a very confusing comment, as it's later claimed that genetic
predisposition to magic is basically discrete -- you're muggle, squib,
or wizard, depending on how many copies of a recessive gene you have,
with nothing in-between (23/`either you have two stones or you
don't. Either you're a wizard or not.`).  It's possible that his
father simply has a psychological block.

"Maybe she was distracted," Harry said without thinking.

McGonagall was distracted by Harry having deduced that Voldemort still
lives, and his subsequent leveage of that information to blackmail
her.

the Incident with the Science Project

The Incident with the Science Project is never directly explained, but
it is speculated to have something to do with a model volcano and fire
engines.  TODO: references.

```
"That's just wrong. That violates every possible rule of game
design. Look, the rest of this game souds like it might make sense,
sort of, for a sport I mean, but you're basically saying that catching
te Snitch overwhelms almost any ordinary point spread. The two Seekers
are up there flying around lookng for the Snitch and usually not
interacting with anyone else, spotting the Snitch first is going tobe
mostly luck -"
```

* original

In the original series, Quidditch played a central role several times,
especially because Harry was nturally good at it.  This comment by
Harry is not only a shot at the terribly-designed game, but alsoa hint
that Quidditch will not be so important in this series.

---

```
"They won't change the game just 'cause you say so!"

"I am the Boy-Who-Lived, you know. People will listen to me. And maybe
if I can persuade them to change the game at Hogwarts, the innovation
will spread.
```

* foreshadowing
* spoiler

Eventually, Harry gets a wish from Professor Quirrell, and he wishes
for Hogwarts to play Quidditch without the snitch (34/`in Hogwarts we
should play Quidditch without the Snitch`), which Quirrell
accomplishes with a clever plot (116/`His last plot`).

he nailed onto a church door, icking off the Protestant Reformation.

This appears to be a small inconsistency with the original series:

"I'd say it's a fine name," said Draco, "but it belongs to the Noble
and Most Ancient House of Black.I'll call you Mr. Silver."

"You get away from... from Mr. Gold," Ron said coldly, and took a
forward step. "He doesn't need to talk to the likes of you!"
```

* subtle

Silver and Gold are the colors of Slytherin and Gryffindor,
respectively, which Drago and Ron will bejoining, respectively.  The
others are trying to align Harry with their future House, although he
maynot realize it.

"Where's the famous Weasley family rat?"
```

* original
* spoiler

In the original series, the Weasley family rat is a transformed Peter
Pettigrew.  In HPMOR it was a normal rat that Bill Weasley thought was
Peter Pettigrew because he had a schizophrenic break (29/`She would've
died. "A rat."`).

```
"Um... his mother helped me figure out how to get to this platform
from the King's Cross Station, so it was kind of hard to tell him to
get lost. And it's not that I hate this Ron guy," Harry said, "I just,
just..." Harry searched for words.

"Don't see any reason for him to exist?" offered Draco.

"Pretty much."
```

* original
* foreshadowing

In the original series, Ron was a major character.  Critics might
describe him as a boring foil to Harry.

In this book, Ron is much less prominant, with Draco taking on the
role of peer/foil.

"Comed-Tea," said the stallholder.

**Comed-Tea** is presumably pronounced like 'comedy', this product is
not seen in the original series.

Maybe I should just chug the whole thing as fast as possible... and
hope my stomach doesn't explode from all the carbon dioxide, or that I

No, he could afford to be a little patient.
```

* spoilers

This is probably the **Comed-Tea** influencing Harry's thought
patterns.  Since it is later revealed that Comed-Tea works by giving
its user a desire to drink at the right time, it must also be able to
prevent its user from exhausting it too soon.

```
"You're welcome. Though one of the assistants must've sworn her

the story mutating as it spreads?

---

```
The way Lucius was looking at you, I thought he was going to c-crucify
you."
```

* speculation
* spoiler

It's not clear why Harry stumbles on the word `crucify` here.  It may
be that his **mysterious dark side**'s patterns started completing the
word to `crucio`, and he had to correct himself.

---

```
"I'll think about it," Harry said in a neutral voice. He shook his
head in wonder. "So you really are his one weak point. Huh."
```

* spoiler
* speculation

This is a little suspicious, and is also referenced later in the
chapter.  It's possible that this information is actually coming from
Harry's **mysterious dark side**.

---

```
BOY-WHO-LIVED GETS
DRACO MALFOY PREGNANT
```

* spoiler
* speculation

Another of the lines that **ship Harry and Draco**.

The first of **Luna's prophecies**, and also the most irritating.  All
of the other prophecies turn out to be true in an extremely literal,
if surprising, way.  This one doesn't appear to have a similar literal
correspondence.

The Author's Note from the next chapter is relevant here:

```
One alert reviewer asked whether, if Luna is a seer, that means this
is going to be an HPDM bottom!Draco mpreg fic. I regret that FFN does
not allow me any larger font size in which to say NO. It honestly
hadn't occurred to me that Luna might be a real seer - I'll have to
decide whether to run with that or not - but I think we can all safely
assume that if Luna is a seer, she said something about "light
planting a seed in darkness", and Xenophilius, as always, interpreted
this in rather the wrong way.
```

So it's possible that the subsequent prophecies were real because the
author decided it was a fun idea, and this one just dates from before
that realization.  It's also possible that this prophecy will become
literally true in the Epilogue, which has not yet been written.

I wonder how difficult it would be to just make a list of all the top
blood purists and kill them.

They'd tried exactly that during the French Revolution, more or less -
make a list of all the enemies of Progress and remove everything above
the neck - and it hadn't worked out well from what Harry recalled.

Harry does, in fact, behead all of the top blood purists during his
final confrontation with Voldemort (114/`Harry wasn't looking there,
he didn't see the falling masks, the blood,`).

Very carefully, now... the bait is set, now the hook... "If you can

broadening his moral sphere to include more than his immediate
political allies.

The implication seems to be that Harry somehow has information he
would only have if he enjoyed Severus Snapes's confidence, perhaps
because that information is leaking over from his **mysterious dark
side**.
