Beneath the moonlight glints a tiny fragment of silver, a fraction of a line...

(black robes, falling)

...blood spills out in litres, and someone screams a word.

Flash-forward to when Harry kills the death eaters (114/`(Black robes,
falling.)`).  The fragment of silver/fraction of a line is the
transfigured spider silk, the black robes falling are the death
eaters, and the word is Harry screaming "STUPORFY".

"Listen. Michael. I wasn't - always like this -"

* departure
* original

This is one of the major points of departure from the original series.
Petunia married an Oxford professor instead of Vernon Dursley because
she was more attractive, which is why Harry was raised in an
intellectually stimulating environment.

"And Lily would tell me no, and make up the most ridiculous excuses,
like the world would end if she were nice to her sister, or a centaur
told her not to - the most ridiculous things, and I hated her for
it."
```

* spoiler

A centaur calls him "Son of Lily" (101/`All I can say, son of Lily`),
and then tries to kill him, after asking whether the Muggles say that
soon the skies will be empty (a reference to the **second prophecy**
about Harry tearing apart the stars in heaven (89/`TEAR APART THE VERY
STARS IN HEAVEN`)).  It's thus quite plausible that the centaurs did
in fact warn Lily that being nice to her sister would cause the end of
the world.

"Anyway," Petunia said, her voice small, "she gave in. She told me it
was dangerous, and I said I didn't care any more, and I drank this
potion and I was sick for weeks, but when I got better my skin cleared
up and I finally filled out and... I was beautiful, people were nice
to me," her voice broke, "and after that I couldn't hate my sister any
more, especially when I learned what her magic brought her in the end
-"
```

Dumbledore gave the recipe for this potion to Lily (17/`You'd get sick
for weeks and maybe die`) (119/`I wrote a strange hint in your
mother's Potions textbook, having no idea why I must; and this proved
to show Lily how to help her sister, and ensured you would gain
Petunia Evans's heartfelt love.`) as part of his
**prophecy-threading** project.

Harry had been sent to the best primary schools - and when that didn't
work out...
```

* spoiler

This didn't work out because of Harry's **mysterious dark side**, and
also because of the potion Dumbledore secretly gave to Harry that
messes with his sleep schedule as part of his **prophecy-threading**
project (119/`I snuck invisibly into your bedroom in Oxford and
administered the potion that is given to students with Time-Turners`).

"If you want to win this argument with Dad, look in chapter two of the
first book of the Feynman Lectures on Physics. There's a quote there
about how philosophers say a great deal about what science absolutely
requires, and it is all wrong, because the only rule in science is
that the final arbiter is observation - that you just have to look at
the world and report what you see.

Except that some part of Harry was utterly convinced that magic was
real, and had been since the instant he saw the putative letter from
the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
```

* spoiler

This "part of Harry" is likely his **mysterious dark side**.

In the original, Mrs. Figg is the witch that the Order of the Phoenix
sent to keep an eye on Harry.
