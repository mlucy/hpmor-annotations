```
ph'nglui mglw'nafh J. K. Rowling wgah'nagl fhtagn
```

* note
* reference

A reference to the Cthulhu mythos, with Rowling replacing Cthulhu in
the quote.  The original quote is "Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh
wgah'nagl fhtagn", which translates from the fictional language
R'lyehian as "In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming."
Interestingly, J.K. Rowling here replaces both Cthulhu and his resting
place.  So the translation would be "In his house at Rowling, dead
J. K. waits dreaming."  This is possibly a mistake, but more likely
the author noted the similarity in pronunciation between R'lyeh and
Rowling.

The implications for the true meaning of this author's note, and
indeed the rest of the series, are clearly enormous.

"Wonder what's wrong with him."
```

* title-quote
* subtle
* spoiler
* speculation

A flash-forward to a student talking about Quirrell later in the
chapter.  Interestingly, all of the other title quotes thus far have
either been from Harry's word's/thoughts, or else about Harry.  So
perhaps this is an early hint that Harry and Quirrell are actually
kind of the same person due to Harry's **mysterious dark side**.

Alternatively, they may simply be the most interesting and thuse
title-quote-worthy characters.

```
"Fine, I promised the Sorting Hat not to talk about most of it and the
rest is private just like yours was so stop asking."
```

* subtle

Clearly he didn't promise the Sorting Hat not to talk about *any* of
it, or else he couldn't have told them about the promise.  A good
introduction to life in Ravenclaw house.

```
"Ssalutations from Sslytherin to Sslytherin: if you would sseek my
ssecretss, sspeak to my ssnake."
```

* spoiler
* original

This is a spell left on the hat by Salazar Slytherin.  It speaks in
parseltongue, which Harry can understand because his **mysterious dark
side** makes him the Heir of Slytherin.  It is giving Harry the first
hint to the location of the Chamber of Secrets.

In the original, the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is accessed by
speaking Parseltongue to a snake-engraved sink in the second-floor
girls' bathroom.  The snake could refer to this, or to the basilisk
itself, a snake-like creature guarding the Chamber of Secrets, which
knows forgotten magics stored away by Salazar Slytherin.

---

```
And that if he could find some reliable way of swearing Draco to
secrecy so he could ask him about it, that would be an excellent time
to have some Comed-Tea handy.
```

* subtle
* spoiler

This may be the **Comed-Tea** influencing his mind, which is a hint
that Draco's reaction to this event would include an event that would
make Harry spit out his drink even if he was trying not to, which may
be a subtle hint that this is a bigger deal than Harry is thinking at
the moment.

---

```
No other name was called out after that, and Harry realised that
"Zabini, Blaise" did sound close to the end of the alphabet. Great, so
now he'd only applauded Zabini... Oh well.
```

* spoiler

Zabini plays a larger role in Harry's first year than he did in the
original series.

---

```
A prospect which was sounding scarier by the minute.

And yet also, somehow, increasingly attractive. Part of his mind was
already visualising the minions' uniforms.
```

```
For the Comed-Tea to work, it would have to make Dumbledore say
something so ridiculous during his speech that even in Harry's state
of mental preparedness, he would still choke. Like, all the Hogwarts
students had to not wear any clothes for the whole school year, or
everyone was going to be transformed into cats.
```

* spoiler

This is probably the **Comed-Tea** influencing his mind, since he is
about to be surprised by Dumbledore's speech.

---

```
...that meant that as soon as he learned a spell to temporarily alter
his own sense of humor, he could make anything happen, by making it so
that he would only find that one thing surprising enough to do a
spit-take, and then drinking a can of Comed-Tea.
```

* subtle
* callback

Interestingly, Harry is arguably making *the exact same mistake* that
Hermione made when *she* was investigating the **Comed-Tea**
(8/`positive bias`) -- He's only running tests that confirm his
Hypothesis that the **Comed-Tea** is omnipotent and altering reality
to make him laugh.  In his defense, it's difficult to come up with a
negative test for that hypothesis.

Harry couldn't help but feel the urge to drink another Comed-Tea.

This is, once again, the **Comed-Tea** affecting Harry's mind.

```
Anyone interested in reformulating the entire game of Quidditch should
contact Harry Potter."
```

* speculation

Dumbledore wasn't around to hear this.  The two main hypothesis are
that he was observing Harry invisibly (for which there is some
speculative evidence at the end of chapter 6 (6/`a last whisper from
behind him`), or that he has already used Legilimency (the mindreading
logic the Hat mentioned) on him

---

```
Why, yes. That sounded like a remarkably good idea once Harry had
actually thought of it.

So very obvious in retrospect, and yet somehow, Option 3c and Option
3d just hadn't occurred to him.
```

* original

In the original series, Harry and his friends consistently attempt to
have adventures without informing adults, even when it would have been
practical or advisable.  While this is an expected departure from the
original series, it is also a nod towards the sometimes-stupid heroism
of its main characters.

---

```
It is guarded by an elaborate series of dangerous and potentially
lethal traps, and you cannot possibly get past all of them, especially
if you are only in your first year.
```

* original

One of the author's favorite side-games is taking things from the
original series that made no sense and trying to change the world to
be consistent with them.

In this case, the idea that Dumbledore would guard the stone with a
set of traps that first-year students can circumvent is ridiculous, so
it's instead turned into a sort of obstacle course for Gryffindors,
with the actual defenses of the stone being somewhat more subtle.

```
"I hope all students will extend Professor Quirrell that utmost
courtesy and tolerance which is due his extraordinary service to you
and this school, and that you will not pester us with any niggling
complaints about him, unless you want to try doing his job."
```

* spoiler

There is a curse on the Defense against the Dark Arts position such
that no teacher has lasted longer than a year, and they're hoping to
at least get the full year out of Quirrell.

---

```
Harry caught a glimpse of the back of his head, and it looked like
Professor Quirrell might already be going bald, despite his seeming
youth.
```

* original

This is a departure from the original, where Quirrell had Voldemort's
face on the back of his head, covered up with a giant turban.

---

```

```

* original
* spoiler

Quirrell is still playing host to Voldemort in HPMOR, but it's unclear
whether the mechanism is the same as in the original and simply hidden
better, or if the mechanics of the Universe are different.
(Regardless, this particular change was probably made because
otherwise it would simply be too easy for Harry.)

In HPMOR, Nicolas Flamel didn't create the philosopher's stone, but
instead obtained it from Baba Yaga, either by murdering her or
marrying her (108/`Baba Yaga`).

Harry was swallowing hard, trying to suppress the sudden surge of
emotion that had overcome him when Professor Quirrell had begun
speaking.
```

It's possible this surge of emotion may also be related to his
**mysterious dark side**.

---

```
Believe it or not, I have long wished to someday try my hand as the
Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts here at the Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
```

This is one of the first hints that Quirrell is still Voldemort in
this universe, as this was one of Voldemort's desires in the original.

---

```
You are my long-awaited students
```

* spoiler

Voldemort has waited longer than one would assume by Quirrell's age.

---

```
Then the vigour and confidence seemed to drain away from Professor
Quirrell. His mouth gaped open as if he had suddenly found himself
facing an unexpected audience, and he turned with a convulsive jerk
and shuffled back to his seat, hunched over as if he was about to
collapse in on himself and implode.
