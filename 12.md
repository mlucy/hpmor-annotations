This is a reference to H. P. Lovercraft's "The Call of Cthulhu", where worshippers of the Old One Cthulhu chant this line in the fictional language R'lyehian.  Here, J. K. Rowling is substituted for Cthulhu.

something that sounded oddly like English and a hiss at the same time

This is Parseltongue, the language of snakes, which Harry inherited from Voldemort, and is strongly tied with House Slytherin.

if you would sseek my ssecretss, sspeak to my ssnake
```

* original

The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is accessed by speaking Parseltongue to a snake-engraved sink in the second-floor girls' bathroom.  The snake could refer to this, or to the basilisk itself, a snake-like creature guarding the Chamber of Secrets, which knows forgotten magics stored away by Salazar Slytherin.

And Harry was struck by the inspiration for a brilliant experimental test.

Hermione had said that Dumbledore was the most powerful wizard alive, right?

Harry reached into his pouch and whispered, "Comed-Tea".

A prospect which was sounding scarier by the minute.

And yet also, somehow, increasingly attractive. Part of his mind was already visualising the minions' uniforms.

Why, yes. That sounded like a remarkably good idea once Harry had actually thought of it.

So very obvious in retrospect, and yet somehow, Option 3c and Option 3d just hadn't occurred to him.
```

* original

In the original series, Harry and his friends consistently attempt to have adventures without informing adults, even when it would have been practical or advisable.  While this is an expected departure from the original series, it is also a nod towards the sometimes-stupid heroism of its main characters.

This is a reference to a self-improvement mantra, sometimes called the Cou√© method, which goes, "Every day, in every way, I'm getting better and better."

I hope all students will extend Professor Quirrell that utmost courtesy and tolerance which is due his extraordinary service to you and this school, and that you will not pester us with any niggling complaints about him, unless you want to try doing his job.
```

This is a reference to the curse upon the Defense of the Dark Arts position, placed by Voldemort when he was refused the position.  Because of it, bad things usually befall the teacher, and Dumbledore is trying anything he can to prevent drama from occurring.

```
The young, thin, nervous man who Harry had first met in the Leaky Cauldron slowly made his way up to the podium, glancing fearfully around in all directions. Harry caught a glimpse of the back of his head, and it looked like Professor Quirrell might already be going bald, despite his seeming youth.
```

* spoiler

In the original series, Voldemort's face is on the back of Quirrell's head, and always covered by a turban.  It appears Quirrell does not wear a turban in this series, likely because it is too obvious of a sign that could be uncovered.  This should also make readers question if Voldemort and Quirrell are still intertwined in this timeline.

Believe it or not, I have long wished to someday try my hand as the Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts here at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
```

* spoiler

Voldemort did apply to become the Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts, and when rejected placed the infamouse curse upon the position.

Voldemort has waited longer than one would assume by Quirrell's age.

Then the vigour and confidence seemed to drain away from Professor Quirrell. His mouth gaped open as if he had suddenly found himself facing an unexpected audience, and he turned with a convulsive jerk and shuffled back to his seat, hunched over as if he was about to collapse in on himself and implode.
